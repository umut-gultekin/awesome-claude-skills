<a id="how-to-install-skills"></a>

## Quick Start

Install Anthropic's document skills in Claude Code from your terminal.

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add anthropics/skills
claude plugin install document-skills@anthropic-agent-skills
```

Provide a PDF, then ask Claude to extract its form fields. Compare the result
with your file. [Read Anthropic's installation guide][anthropic-install].

<details>
<summary><strong>Other collections, standalone skills, and updates</strong></summary>

Use each source repository's install guide. Collections may ship as plugins,
individual folders, or both. Choose one route for each collection.

For a standalone Claude Code skill, put its folder in
`~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/` for personal use, or
`.claude/skills/<skill-name>/` for one project. Keep `SKILL.md` and its supporting
files together. See the [Claude Code skill guide][skill-guide].

Follow the [plugin update guide][plugin-updates] for plugin installs.
For standalone folders, use the source repository's update instructions.
Cloning this directory does not install the listed skills.

</details>

## FAQ

<a id="what-are-skills"></a>

<details>
<summary><strong>What is a skill?</strong></summary>

A skill is a folder containing instructions in `SKILL.md`, with optional
scripts and resources. Claude loads it when relevant to a task, or you can
invoke it directly. See the [skill guide][skill-guide].

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Does every skill work in every Claude app?</strong></summary>

The format is shared, but tools and installation differ by host. A Claude Code
plugin does not install itself in Claude.ai or the API. Check the source's
supported environments and [Anthropic's separate install routes][anthropic-install].

</details>

<a id="skills-vs-mcp-vs-system-prompts"></a>

<details>
<summary><strong>Skills, MCP, or project instructions?</strong></summary>

| You need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| A repeatable task or workflow | [Skills][skill-guide] |
| Access to an external service or tool | [Model Context Protocol (MCP)][mcp-guide] |
| Conventions Claude reads for a project | [Project instructions][memory-guide] |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Are the listed skills tested or audited?</strong></summary>

This is a community directory, not a certification program. Read the source
instructions and scripts, then try the skill on a task whose result you can
check. Report broken links or incorrect descriptions through [issues][suggest].

<summary><strong>Can I create or contribute a skill?</strong></summary>
